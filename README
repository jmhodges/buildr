Create your own Buildfile and start living the life!


== Where's My Ruby?

Buildr needs Ruby 1.8 or later and RubyGems 0.9 or later. All other dependencies are installed when you run:
  gem install buildr

=== Windows

Windows users can get the one-click Ruby installer, which includes the latest version of Ruby and RubyGems:

http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org

=== Linux and OS/X

If you're running Linux or OS/X you may already have Ruby installed, or you can get it through the usual channels:
  yum install ruby
  apt-get install ruby
  emerge ruby

You can get RubyGems here: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126

To install:
  tar -xz < rubygems-0.9.2.tgz
  cd rubygems-0.9.2
  sudo ruby setup.rb
  sudo gem install rubygems-update


== Living On the Edge

You can check the latest sources from SVN:
  svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/buildr/trunk
Or browse the SVN repository online: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/buildr

To install Buildr locally from source, do:

  cd buildr
  rake install

If the cutting edge doesn't work, make sure to check the CHANGELOG, to see which changes might have broken your build.

h3.  Bugs resulting from a dangling comma or period

Ruby statements don't need a delimiter and can span multiple lines, which can
lead to bugs resulting from dangling commas and periods left at the end of the
line.  For example:

{{{!ruby
compile.with 'org.apache.axis2:axis2:jar:1.2',
test.with 'log4j:log4j:jar:1.1'
}}}

This is actually a single method call with two arguments, separated by a comma.
The second argument is the result of calling @test.with@, and makes the test
task a pre-requisite of the compile task, leading to a circular dependency.

As you can imagine this happens usually after editing, specifically for commas
and periods which are small enough that you won't notice them from a cursory
glance at the code, so if all else fails, search for lines that end with one of
these characters.

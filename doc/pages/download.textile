h1. Download and Installation

The current release of Buildr works with Ruby 1.8.  We do not yet support Ruby 1.9 or JRuby.


h2. Windows

If you don't already have Ruby installed, now is the time to do it.  The
easiest way to install Ruby is using the "one-click
installer":http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/.

Before installing Buildr, please set the @JAVA_HOME@ environment variable to
point to your JDK distribution.  Next, use Ruby Gem to install Buildr:

{{{!sh
> gem install buildr
}}}

Buildr uses several libraries that include native extensions.  During
installation it will ask you to pick a platform for these libraries.  By
selecting @mswin32@ it will download and install pre-compiled DLLs for these
extensions.

To upgrade to a new version of Buildr:

{{{!sh
> gem update buildr
}}}

To install a specific version of Buildr:

{{{!sh
> gem install buildr -v 1.3.0
}}}


h2.  Linux, BSD, Cygwin

To get started you will need a recent version of Ruby, Ruby Gems and build
tools for compiling native libraries (Make and GCC).

On Ubuntu you can setup your environment by installing the following packages:

{{{!sh
$ sudo apt-get install ruby
$ sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
}}}

Other distributions may use different package manages, like @yum@ and @emerge@.

Before installing Buildr, please set the @JAVA_HOME@ environment variable to
point to your JDK distribution.  Next, use Ruby Gem to install Buildr:

{{{!sh
$ sudo env JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME gem install buildr
}}}

Buildr uses several libraries that include native extensions.  During
installation it will ask you to pick a platform for these libraries.  By
selecting @ruby@ it will download the source code for these extensions and
compile them to work on your machine.

{{{!sh
$ sudo env JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME gem update buildr
}}}

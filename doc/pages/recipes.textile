h2.  Configuration

h4.  Keeping your Profiles.yaml file DRY

YAML allows you to write an object (map, array, etc) once and reference it in
several places using anchors and aliases (@&@ and @*@).  For example, if you
have several profiles, all with the same information, you can write this:

{{{!yaml
development: &common
  db: oracle
  port: 8080
test: *common
production: *common
}}}

You can use the merge key (@<<@) to create a name/value map that merges default
values from another name/value map, for example:

{{{!yaml
common: &common
  db: oracle
  port: 8080
development:
  <<: *common
  db: hsql
test: *common
production: *common
}}}

Step 1, join the "mailing list":mailing_lists.html.  It's the best place to
ask questions, report "features", submit patches and let us know how you use
Buildr in your own projects.

Step 2, checkout "Buildr from
SVN":http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/buildr:

{{{!sh
$ svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/buildr/trunk buildr
}}}

You can also search the "Buildr
repository":http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/buildr.

Step 3, install Buildr from your working copy:

{{{!sh
$ cd buildr
$ rake install
}}}

(@sudo rake install@ if you're running on Linux)

Step 4, send a patch to the mailing list.  And please help us by providing a
proper test case.  Buildr uses "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/ , a
behavior-driven development test framework.  Check out the existing tests
(specs) in the @spec@ directory, and make sure they all pass by running:

{{{!sh
$ rake spec
}}}
